Data Structures
1. Why are data structures useful in programming?
They allow you to store, organize and access information quickly.

Arrays
2. Define "array" and describe the characteristics of an array.
An array is a data structure which stores things in an index.

3. Give two original examples of data sets that an array might be well-suited for.
A list of name of places you like to eat.
A list of attendance.

Hashes
4. Define "hash" and describe the characteristics of a hash.
A hash is a data structure that stores items in "key" and "value" pairs.

5. Give two original examples of data sets that a hash might be well-suited for.
Name and population of a US cities.
A form you'd like people to fill out (keys are provided by you and values are user-input)

Iteration
6. Why is iteration useful?
It moves through a data set automatically based on the logic you provide, without you having to do it manually.

7. Give an example of a real-life task that would require iteration if you wrote an algorithm for it.
Taking and array of names and removing names if they contain a specific letter.

Blocks
8. What is a block?
Anything inside a do and end pair

9. What is a block parameter, and where does its value come from?
It holds the place of what you'll be doing to the data structure.
