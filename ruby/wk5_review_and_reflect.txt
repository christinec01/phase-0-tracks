Data Structures
1. Why are data structures useful in programming?
They allow you to store information and access it anytime you need it.

Arrays
2. Define "array" and describe the characteristics of an array.
A collection(list) of objects that all have a designated index (ordered)

3. Give two original examples of data sets that an array might be well-suited for.
Taking inventory of your closet (listing out everything in your closet)
Name and age of students. This would be an array of arrays ie students = [(name1,age1), (name2,age2), ...]

Hashes
4. Define "hash" and describe the characteristics of a hash.
A hash is a type of data set that takes key:value pairs and stores them. Keys/values can be accessed, changed, and added to.

5. Give two original examples of data sets that a hash might be well-suited for.
A survey wherein you provide the keys and prompt the user to provide values.
A company's Org chart
Company = {
Senior leadership: {
finance:,
marketing:,
legal:,
}
HR:{human resources dept}
etc..
}

Iteration
6. Why is iteration useful?
Iteration allows us to run a block of code as many times as needed without having to repeat code (Dont Repeat Yourself).

7. Give an example of a real-life task that would require iteration if you wrote an algorithm for it.
Prompting the user if they'd like to fill out another form (perhaps a family registering each child for summer school)

Blocks
8. What is a block?
A block is just a section of code that's grouped together

9. What is a block parameter, and where does its value come from?
A block parameter is the method you wrap your block of code in.
