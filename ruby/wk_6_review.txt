1. What are classes? Be sure to define the following terms in your explanation and describe the relationships between them:
A class is a special object that has attributes which an be shared with its 'children' - or instances of that class.
state- defines the attributes of instances
behavior- what the class does
instance variable- a variable that only exists inside
instance method- a method which is only accessible from within the class

2. What are attributes?
Attributes are the things that make up the class

3. Give an example of a real world object, and describe how you might assign its attributes if you were to design a class to represent that object.
A coffee object might have roast and body attributes which each instance of the coffee class would inherit

4. What is the purpose of the initialize method? When does it run?
The initialize method creates new instances of the class. It runs when you want to create a new instance of a class.

5. What are modules?
Modules are collections of methods and symbols. A module can inherit instance methods from a class and/or have methods of their own.

6. What are the different ways you can use a module?
If you have several different classes of things that you want to give one or several of the same methods to you could use a module.
