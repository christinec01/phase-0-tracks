My plan for tackling learning jQuery is to start by looking up the docs and getting an
idea of the basics jQuery commands- what they do, how they work and how to add them to my code.
This should take 10 minutes (only getting a high level at this point, earmarking references for later)

Next, I'd look up some examples of jQuery being used so I could see it in action. This should only take me a couple of minutes but I know its an important step for me to see the new thing I'm learning in action.

Finally, in 40 minute chunks, I'd start my project - first off by setting up the basic elements of the project (the html, css and js files) and add content to them.

In my next 40-60 minute block I'd add my jQuery code.

This in total comes to about 2 hours!
