Linux philosophy seems to be that they believe the user has a knowledge and even appreciation for computers.

Linux seems not to spend time on making their operating system user-friendly. They work under the assumption that the user is already able to navigate the computer without issues. They focus instead on making the product beautiful and "sexy".

The final component of Linux is the power to customize your experience. They give the user a wide degree of freedom with which to create the environment of their choosing.
